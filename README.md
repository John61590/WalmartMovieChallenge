# WalmartMovieChallenge

Interview problem / coding challenge for Android Developer at Walmart Labs.
This app uses the API at The Movie DB (themoviedb.org) to show movies. The full assignment PDF
can be found in the repository at "Android Assignment ASDA.pdf" The design uses tiles that
follow the material design guidelines. It also implements lazy loading by using a library
that implements two-phased load with a progress bar shown at the bottom of the list as it loads.
It works for both phones and tablets.

Some screenshots can be found below. Additional ones can be found in the repository.
